## Summary / Abstract

Determining the freshness of fruits and vegetables is usually carried out by visual and sensory assessments, such as color, texture, and aroma. However, these methods are subjective and not always accurate. Some people have a lot of trouble when finding fresh fruits and vegetables in the store because they have to rely on "sensitivity". Sometimes people buy without knowing if it's fresh or not and when they get out of stores and want to eat them, they realize that the fruits and vegetables they bought are not fresh. People simply get angry because of that. In most stores they don’t provide tools to determine whether fruits and vegetables are fresh or not. So we asked ourselves “Why don’t we make an application for this?”.  To ensure the effectiveness of this app, we need to determine how accurate the image recognition technology is compared to the direct user assessment method and how the app's use will impact consumer confidence in selecting fresh produce. 

## How did you come up with this project?

We noticed that a lot of people have trouble finding fresh ingredients such as vegetables and fruits. To address this issue, we developed an application to help people find fresh vegetables and fruits before buying in store. By providing consumers with this knowledge, we aim to improve decision making at the point of purchase and create a more sustainable and healthier food system. This app will detect which fruits and vegetables are fresh or not based on the image. We will collect appropriate datasets and create a model that helps identify the freshness of fruits and vegetables.
